Here’s the text in <code>step2.txt</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>The next message I got from my friend was strange. I think there was something wrong with her phone. The message I got was just &quot;Going to 727774447777&quot;. Did she want to type a phone number or something was wrong with her phone? Could that be the hint to find the clue to her next location? \n\nThe place she was travelling to (lowercase -&gt; hash) is the password.\n</code></pre>\n<p>That doesn’t look like any phone number I’ve ever seen, but the mention of a phone is a big hint! Unfortunately, many of The Seint’s readers may not be old enough to remember phones that looked like this:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/04-Nokia-3310-wikipedia.png\" alt=\"Nokia 3310\" width=\"400\" height=\"912\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/04-Nokia-3310-wikipedia-xs.png 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/04-Nokia-3310-wikipedia-sm.png 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/04-Nokia-3310-wikipedia-md.png 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/04-Nokia-3310-wikipedia-lg.png 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/04-Nokia-3310-wikipedia-xl.png 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/04-Nokia-3310-wikipedia-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>(<em>I used to tweet with a phone like this!</em>)</p>\n<p>When sending SMS, or writing contact names, we used to have to tap a number key repeatedly to get the right letter. For example, tapping ‘7’ once gave us ‘P’, but tapping it three times gave us ‘R’. With that information, it should be easy to work out what the numbers represent, and we can get our MD5 hash.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-multi-tap-phone-cipher\">The Multi-tap Phone Cipher</h4>\n<p>If you ever get a longer string of numbers to decrypt, you might want to automate things. There is no Operation in CyberChef for this type of cipher, but luckily CyberChef isn’t the only game in town, and we can use the French <a href=\"https://www.dcode.fr/multitap-abc-cipher\">dCode</a> site, which has such a decoder (<em>and encoder in case you ever want to set your own fun puzzles</em>).\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/05-dcode.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of dcode.fr\" width=\"1008\" height=\"507\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/05-dcode-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/05-dcode-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/05-dcode-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/05-dcode-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/05-dcode-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/05-dcode-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>And with that, we’re off to Part 3!</p>\n",

There are <strong>operations</strong> on the left, which can be combined in order to create a <strong>recipe</strong> in the centre (you can simply drag the operations over). The recipe takes one ingredient (<strong>Input</strong>, top right), and hopefully bakes a nice <strong>Output</strong> (bottom right). There are lots of operations you can perform in CyberChef, but we’re only interested in one for now.</p>\n<p>Using either the Search function or by browsing in the section titled Hashing, find <strong>MD5</strong> and drag it into the recipe. Type “summer” in the Input field and watch the hash magically appear in the Output field:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/01-cyberchef.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of CyberChef\" width=\"961\" height=\"577\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>You can now unzip the archive and see what files we’ve got for Stage 1:</p>\n<pre><code>step1.txt\nstep1 - hint 1.txt\nstep1 - hint 2.txt\nstep2.zip\n</code></pre>\n<p>Try and avoid the hints if you possibly can; they’re there for if you really get stuck!</p>\n<p>Last year, The Seint started us off fairly gently, so let’s see if we’re getting the same treatment this year. Here’s <code>step1.txt</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>This summer, I got a message from my friend. I knew she was planning to visit Europe, but didn&#39;t have any clue where she was going. The message said: &quot;I came to a city that welcomed me with a puzzle. While sightseeing I was tricked to go to the train station an hour earlier. And that&#39;s all because of the cathedral bells ringing noon not at the time you&#39;d expect them to. While I ran down from the hill along a little street named after a president, just behind that cathedral I noticed a skull painted by a gate. Just behing that gate somebody left a piece of cloth. Its color is the password that will let you find my next exact location.&quot;\n\nMake a hash of the color name to uncover the next step.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a really good scenario for highlighting something The Seint says in the introduction to this CTF: <em><strong>Remember that the tools aren’t enough. Use your open mind and try not to fall in the mind traps.</strong></em></p>\n<p>It’s tempting to rely on tools in the OSINT world, but occasionally you just have to charm Google or Bing with the right search term (<em>much like we’re all learning how to craft prompts to get the most out of our new AI tools</em>). So let’s try and find a European city whose cathedral bells ring noon an hour early. It took several iterations before I found the answer with:\n<code>&quot;europe cathedral ringing noon at 11&quot;</code></p>\n<p>Which led to a promising result:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/02-brno.jpg\" alt=\"Google search results\" width=\"627\" height=\"127\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>The ‘little street named after a president’ turns out to be too little to find on an overhead view in Google Maps, so I ended up doing what I often do in CTFs, which is simply to have a good hunt around ‘on foot’, i.e., in Street View. Eventually, I found the skull on an alley named after the first president of the Czech Repulic:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/03-skull.jpg\" alt=\"Image of alley behind Brno Cathedral.

(<em>The relevant image was taken in 2017, so if it’s replaced with a more recent image before you try this CTF, you might need to use the Street View Timeline to go back to 2017</em>) Hashing the cloth’s colour allows us to open <code>step2.zip</code>, and you can see how I get on with that step in the next post!</p>\n<h6 id=\"im-stuck\">I’m stuck!</h6>\n<p>If you can’t find the gate by plodding around Brno cathedral, you’re welcome to click on the spoiler below. This will take you to the location of the gate in Google Maps, and you should be able to find the cloth fairly easily.</p>\n<p><details>\n    <summary><strong>Spoiler</strong></summary>\n    <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@49.1912386,16.6081611,3a,75y,166.93h,98.71t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWnBnK_ZUr2um8CfmkEunKA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656\">Google Maps</a>\n</details></p>\n\n<h6 id=\"takeaway\">Takeaway</h6>\n<p>Sometimes, there’s no substitute for simply spending a bit of time trying lots of variations of search terms (and search engines), or wandering around aimlessly in Google Street View.
