Spoilers ahead!</em></p>\n<p>The first thing I noticed is that <em>The Sun</em> is capitalised. Maybe living in the UK is an advantage, but that jumped out at me as a hint that The Seint’s friend is talking about the UK. Unfortunately, despite being a terrible publication, The Sun is still one of Britain’s bestselling ‘news’papers. And I’m pretty sure that when thinking about the UK, and <em>a bridge between two towers</em>, we will all be thinking of Tower Bridge? Despite having walked over the bridge several times (and run over it during the London Marathon), I had no idea that it features a glass floor, but sure enough, here it is on the upper deck:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/4/12-glass-floor.jpg\" alt=\"Glass floor at Tower Bridge\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/12-glass-floor-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/12-glass-floor-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/12-glass-floor-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/12-glass-floor-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/12-glass-floor-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/12-glass-floor-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>Having decided to trust The Seint on dates too, I realised that we were talking about 8th August 2022.

More on that later, but first let’s take a look at the clue:</p>\n<pre><code>The next message came on the first day of August. It said: &quot;I know you found the cloth in Brno. The colour reminded me of a song and a movie from 1984 that had the same title. I remembered there was a place named just like the song and wanted to find it while being in Paris. I found the place on the map, but the shop wasn&#39;t there. People said it moved some time ago. I came to the nearest intersection and tried to look left first, but the sun was shining right into my eyes, just along the street. What was the time?&quot;\n\nThe exact time in HH:MM format turned into a hash is the password to the next message. The time must be in that place&#39;s timezone.\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a long time Prince fan, I had no problem with the shop. I just opened up Google Maps in Paris, and searched for “Purple Rain”:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/06-purple-rain.jpg\" alt=\"Purple Rain, in Paris\" width=\"955\" height=\"544\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>However, this is when I fell down the rabbit hole, jumping into Street View when there was no need. I walked up to the nearest intersection and saw that the most recent image was from May 2022. That persuaded me that The Seint couldn’t have been talking about 1 August 2022, and I would need to jump into the timeline…</p>\n<p>Sure enough, the sun was shining right into the Google camera in August <strong>2020</strong>:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/07-blinded.jpg\" alt=\"View of street in Paris, sun shining directly into camera.\" width=\"1279\" height=\"743\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>Of course, part of my brain said “that’s <strong>not</strong> looking left from the intersection, it’s looking right back”, but I managed to convince myself I was right, and fired up <a href=\"https://www.suncalc.org/#/48.8731,2.3451,18/2020.08.01/10:24/1/3\">SunCalc</a>, looking in <em>completely the wrong direction</em>, on <em>completely the wrong date</em>, but somehow still  convinced that I was right!\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/08-suncalc-1.jpg\" alt=\"SunCalc simulation of sun in Paris on 01/08/2020\" width=\"1100\" height=\"564\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>This gave me a time of around 10:24 local. I hashed that, and a couple of minutes each way, and tried entering those hashes into the Zip for the next level. Nada. I then tried a few more minutes each way. Still nothing. I went back to StreetView and looked for any other indications of the time, and came away scratching my head. I wasn’t going to spend the rest of the day hashing random times, so I decided to fire up Python and ChatGPT. Thanks to Advent of Code, I’m already familiar with <code>hashlib</code>, but I potentially wanted to generate a lot of hashes. I simply asked ChatGPT to write a loop to format times from 09:00 to 11:30 in the format “hh:mm” and hash them all. It took ChatGPT about five seconds to write this:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/09-code-1.jpg\" alt=\"Python code to hash formatted times\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1298\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>Of course, this resulted in 150 hashes, and there was no way I was going to try and apply them by hand…\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/10-chatgpt.jpg\" alt=\"ChatGPT conversation\" width=\"758\" height=\"641\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>With the information about exception handling, which I already know about, I soon had a loop that tried all 150 hashes against the Zip for Part 4. Still nothing! 🤬</p>\n<p>At this point, since I basically now had a tool that could brute force the answer, I decided to widen the parameters, find the correct time, and then try to figure out where I went wrong. The correct time turned out to be a fair bit later in the day: 14:17.</p>\n<p>Back to SunCalc, and moving the clock forward to the right time made me realise I should have been listening to my doubts:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/11-suncalc-2.jpg\" alt=\"SunCalc simulation of sun in Paris on 01/08/2020\" width=\"1081\" height=\"589\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>Of course, <strong>this is looking left</strong> from the intersection, just as The Seint said. But the sun isn’t completely lined up… Eventually the penny dropped that if The Seint was right about the direction, maybe I need to think again about the date. It is the 2022 puzzle after all, and I only ended up looking at 2020 for spurious reasons. Sure enough, on 01/08/2022, at 14:17, <a href=\"https://www.suncalc.org/#/48.8731,2.3451,18/2022.08.01/14:17/1/3\">the sun lines up beautifully</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, then, with a painful reminder that <em>confirmation bias</em> is always a consideration when conducting OSINT or any kind of investigation, it was off to Part 4!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Feature photo is a crop of an original by <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/the-louvre-pyramid-in-france-during-the-golden-hour-11783046/\">Mathias Reding @ Pexels</a></em></p>\n",

There are <strong>operations</strong> on the left, which can be combined in order to create a <strong>recipe</strong> in the centre (you can simply drag the operations over). The recipe takes one ingredient (<strong>Input</strong>, top right), and hopefully bakes a nice <strong>Output</strong> (bottom right). There are lots of operations you can perform in CyberChef, but we’re only interested in one for now.</p>\n<p>Using either the Search function or by browsing in the section titled Hashing, find <strong>MD5</strong> and drag it into the recipe. Type “summer” in the Input field and watch the hash magically appear in the Output field:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/01-cyberchef.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of CyberChef\" width=\"961\" height=\"577\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/01-cyberchef-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>You can now unzip the archive and see what files we’ve got for Stage 1:</p>\n<pre><code>step1.txt\nstep1 - hint 1.txt\nstep1 - hint 2.txt\nstep2.zip\n</code></pre>\n<p>Try and avoid the hints if you possibly can; they’re there for if you really get stuck!</p>\n<p>Last year, The Seint started us off fairly gently, so let’s see if we’re getting the same treatment this year. Here’s <code>step1.txt</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>This summer, I got a message from my friend. I knew she was planning to visit Europe, but didn&#39;t have any clue where she was going. The message said: &quot;I came to a city that welcomed me with a puzzle. While sightseeing I was tricked to go to the train station an hour earlier. And that&#39;s all because of the cathedral bells ringing noon not at the time you&#39;d expect them to. While I ran down from the hill along a little street named after a president, just behind that cathedral I noticed a skull painted by a gate. Just behing that gate somebody left a piece of cloth. Its color is the password that will let you find my next exact location.&quot;\n\nMake a hash of the color name to uncover the next step.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a really good scenario for highlighting something The Seint says in the introduction to this CTF: <em><strong>Remember that the tools aren’t enough. Use your open mind and try not to fall in the mind traps.</strong></em></p>\n<p>It’s tempting to rely on tools in the OSINT world, but occasionally you just have to charm Google or Bing with the right search term (<em>much like we’re all learning how to craft prompts to get the most out of our new AI tools</em>). So let’s try and find a European city whose cathedral bells ring noon an hour early. It took several iterations before I found the answer with:\n<code>&quot;europe cathedral ringing noon at 11&quot;</code></p>\n<p>Which led to a promising result:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/02-brno.jpg\" alt=\"Google search results\" width=\"627\" height=\"127\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-xs.jpg 300w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-sm.jpg 480w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-md.jpg 768w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/02-brno-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></p>\n<p>The ‘little street named after a president’ turns out to be too little to find on an overhead view in Google Maps, so I ended up doing what I often do in CTFs, which is simply to have a good hunt around ‘on foot’, i.e., in Street View. Eventually, I found the skull on an alley named after the first president of the Czech Repulic:\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/1/03-skull.jpg\" alt=\"Image of alley behind Brno Cathedral.

(<em>The relevant image was taken in 2017, so if it’s replaced with a more recent image before you try this CTF, you might need to use the Street View Timeline to go back to 2017</em>) Hashing the cloth’s colour allows us to open <code>step2.zip</code>, and you can see how I get on with that step in the <a href=\"https://osint-news.github.io/the-seints-christmas-ctf-part-2.html\">next post</a>!</p>\n<h6 id=\"im-stuck\">I’m stuck!</h6>\n<p>If you can’t find the gate by plodding around Brno cathedral, you’re welcome to click on the spoiler below.
