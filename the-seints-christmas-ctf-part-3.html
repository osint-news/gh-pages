It’s an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"><em>confirmation bias</em></a>, which can be a problem with any investigation. The key takeaway is to <strong>trust The Seint</strong>!</p><p><em>If you want to go back to the beginning of this walkthrough, you can find it <a href="https://osint-news.github.io/osint-walkthrough-the-seint-ctf-2022.html">here</a>. <strong>Spoilers ahead!</strong></em></p><p>One upside of falling down the rabbit hole is that it gave me a chance to play with ChatGPT, which is clearly going to be a key ingredient in OSINT work in future, if only for the speed-up it gives you with coding. More on that later, but first let’s take a look at the clue:</p><pre><code>The next message came on the first day of August. It said: &quot;I know you found the cloth in Brno. The colour reminded me of a song and a movie from 1984 that had the same title. I remembered there was a place named just like the song and wanted to find it while being in Paris. I found the place on the map, but the shop wasn&#39;t there. People said it moved some time ago. I came to the nearest intersection and tried to look left first, but the sun was shining right into my eyes, just along the street. What was the time?&quot;

The exact time in HH:MM format turned into a hash is the password to the next message. The time must be in that place&#39;s timezone.
</code></pre><p>As a long time Prince fan, I had no problem with the shop. I just opened up Google Maps in Paris, and searched for “Purple Rain”:</p><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/06-purple-rain.jpg" alt="Purple Rain, in Paris" width="955" height="544" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-xs.jpg 300w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-sm.jpg 480w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-md.jpg 768w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-lg.jpg 1024w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-xl.jpg 1360w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/06-purple-rain-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p></p><p>However, this is when I fell down the rabbit hole, jumping into Street View when there was no need. I walked up to the nearest intersection and saw that the most recent image was from May 2022. That persuaded me that The Seint couldn’t have been talking about 1 August 2022, and I would need to jump into the timeline…</p><p>Sure enough, the sun was shining right into the Google camera in August <strong>2020</strong>:</p><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/07-blinded.jpg" alt="View of street in Paris, sun shining directly into camera." width="1279" height="743" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-xs.jpg 300w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-sm.jpg 480w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-md.jpg 768w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-lg.jpg 1024w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-xl.jpg 1360w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/07-blinded-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p></p><p>Of course, part of my brain said “that’s <strong>not</strong> looking left from the intersection, it’s looking right back”, but I managed to convince myself I was right, and fired up <a href="https://www.suncalc.org/#/48.8731,2.3451,18/2020.08.01/10:24/1/3">SunCalc</a>, looking in <em>completely the wrong direction</em>, on <em>completely the wrong date</em>, but somehow still convinced that I was right!</p><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/08-suncalc-1.jpg" alt="SunCalc simulation of sun in Paris on 01/08/2020" width="1100" height="564" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-xs.jpg 300w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-sm.jpg 480w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-md.jpg 768w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-lg.jpg 1024w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-xl.jpg 1360w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/08-suncalc-1-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p></p><p>This gave me a time of around 10:24 local. I hashed that, and a couple of minutes each way, and tried entering those hashes into the Zip for the next level. Nada. I then tried a few more minutes each way. Still nothing. I went back to StreetView and looked for any other indications of the time, and came away scratching my head. I wasn’t going to spend the rest of the day hashing random times, so I decided to fire up Python and ChatGPT. Thanks to Advent of Code, I’m already familiar with <code>hashlib</code>, but I potentially wanted to generate a lot of hashes. I simply asked ChatGPT to write a loop to format times from 09:00 to 11:30 in the format “hh:mm” and hash them all. It took ChatGPT about five seconds to write this:</p><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/09-code-1.jpg" alt="Python code to hash formatted times" width="1360" height="1298" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-xs.jpg 300w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-sm.jpg 480w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-md.jpg 768w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-lg.jpg 1024w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-xl.jpg 1360w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/09-code-1-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p></p><p>Of course, this resulted in 150 hashes, and there was no way I was going to try and apply them by hand…</p><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/10-chatgpt.jpg" alt="Image of ChatGPT conversation" width="758" height="641" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-xs.jpg 300w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-sm.jpg 480w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-md.jpg 768w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-lg.jpg 1024w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-xl.jpg 1360w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/10-chatgpt-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p></p><p>With the information about exception handling, which I already know about, I soon had a loop that tried all 150 hashes against the Zip for Part 4. Still nothing! 🤬</p><p>At this point, since I basically now had a tool that could brute force the answer, I decided to widen the parameters, find the correct time, and then try to figure out where I went wrong. The correct time turned out to be a fair bit later in the day: 14:17.</p><p>Back to SunCalc, and moving the clock forward to the right time made me realise I should have been listening to my doubts:</p><p></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/11-suncalc-2.jpg" alt="SunCalc simulation of sun in Paris on 01/08/2020" width="1081" height="589" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-md.jpg 768w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://osint-news.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/11-suncalc-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p></p><p>Of course, <strong>this is looking left</strong> from the intersection, just as The Seint said. But the sun isn’t completely lined up… Eventually the penny dropped that if The Seint was right about the direction, maybe I need to think again about the date. It is the 2022 puzzle after all, and I only ended up looking at 2020 for spurious reasons.
